On my 5th birthday, I received a book entitled "World under the microscope," which opened up a whole new world of science to me, full of fascinating facts and complicated laboratory equipment. Over the years (apart from accumulating a lot of science books), I have developed an interest in different areas of science such as geology, paleontology, and astronomy, which remain my hobbies today. Fascination with insects resulted in a Master thesis in entomology. My career goals in fundamental research were set during this period with several courses in evolutionary biology, population genetics, as well as the opportunity to work with the Drosophila model system.

I enjoy doing both experimental and computational work. As a Drosophila scientist, this is how I describe my perfect experiment: First, a new idea hatches followed by the formation of a robust experimental design and fly rearing. The idea then matures into data analysis. After some time, coffee and tears, what started as a simple belief metamorphs into beautiful plots on your computer screen, which are then free to fly off and evolve into understanding. In the age of sequencing technologies and computers, we tend to get caught up in large data sets, lines of code, and long strings of sequences, forgetting that those simple four letters (A, T, C, G) reside inside all living forms on Earth. There is nothing like the feeling of a small deletion you have denoted "marker" showing up on a gel from a fly many generations away.
